# RAG-System
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to build an intelligent PDF-based Question Answering chatbot using LangChain, FAISS, and Groq’s LLMs like mixtral-8x7b-32768. The goal is to allow users to upload a PDF and ask questions about its content — with accurate, context-aware answers generated in real-time.
